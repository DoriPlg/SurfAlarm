This is a short project done for my own joy, using bits from other projects.
I started it because I found an old Rasberry Pi, and decided to use it as a greenlight for surfing.

Usage:
Use _cron_ to run the script once every morning, use the following:
0 7 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/path/to/script/main.py run
